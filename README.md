# Module_1-Challenge
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
(As captured from Data Bootcamp Module 1.0.2) 

This challenge is to demonstrate the ability to do the following.  
1.	Import data into a table for analysis.
2.	Apply filters, conditional formatting, and formulas.
3.	Generate and interpret pivot tables.
4.	Calculate summary statistics such as measures of central tendency, standard deviation, and variance.
5.	Characterize data to identify outliers in datasets.
6.	Perform an Excel analysis with visualizations.
7.	Interpret Excel visualizations.

### Purpose
(This module is built around a project that mirrors a real-world scenario that would require data analysis and visualization.)

As a Data Analyst, I am helping an up-and-coming playwright, Louise, who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play. An initial analysis of Kickstarter data was conducted to assist a client (Louise) in determining how different campaigns fared regarding their launch dates and funding goals. The Client, Louise, is hesitant about jumping into her first fundraising campaign and thus has now asked for a follow-up analysis.
For this analysis, we will determine the number of successful, failed, or canceled outcomes based on launch dates by month and the funding goal ranges.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
# Deliverable 1: Analysis of "Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart"
Initially, I provided Louise (my Client) with a visual summary of the data via pivot tables. (See Kickstart File Worksheet tab labeled "Outcomes by Launch Date" and the related chart, "Outcomes by Launch Date.png," which illustrates the following: 

•	The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. However, January, June, July, and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched.

Narrowing down to focus to Parent Category "Theater" * due to the Client's interest in the theater data.

In addition, Louise (my Client) would benefit from additional data visualization to see the outcomes of all the categories. As such as the assigned Data Analyst, I need to add visualizations using the same data by creating summary tables, charts, and graphs.

See the Kickstart File Worksheet tab labeled "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" and the related chart, "Theather_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png," which illustrates the following:

•	By glancing at the data, we can determine that theater is a popular and successful type of campaign overall. Using filters, we can see that theater follows the overall trend: a spike of successful campaigns that began in June but that tapers off by the end of the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
